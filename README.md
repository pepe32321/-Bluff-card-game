# 'Bluff' card game

Project's goal is to implement 'Bluff' card game in Python where players are defined bots and use heuristic algoritms to optimise decision making strategy.

Each player starts with one card, tries to guess what is the highest poker figure on the table then decides if to bid higher figure or check the previous player.
The player who was wrong starts the next turn with one card more on his hand.
If player recives 6th card he loses.
The last player at the table is the winner.

The implementation of the game in Python is ready.
The next step is to create better decision algoritm with parameters which can be optimised.
Then the chosen heuristic algoritm will be used to optimise the parameters.
